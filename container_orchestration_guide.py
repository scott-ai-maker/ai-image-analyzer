ðŸŽ¯ Container Orchestration & Deployment - Hands-on Guide

This teaches you Docker and Kubernetes patterns used by major tech companies.
YOU'LL learn the deployment strategies that power production systems at scale.

Key concepts you'll implement:
1. Multi-stage Dockerfiles for production
2. Kubernetes Deployments with proper resource limits
3. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
4. Rolling updates and zero-downtime deployments
5. ConfigMaps and Secrets management

This shows how Google, Netflix, and Uber deploy applications!

ðŸš€ Container Orchestration & Deployment Learning Path
=====================================================

PHASE 1: DOCKER FUNDAMENTALS
-----------------------------
Step 1: Create production Dockerfile
Step 2: Multi-stage builds for optimization
Step 3: Container security best practices
Step 4: Local testing with Docker Compose

PHASE 2: KUBERNETES BASICS
---------------------------
Step 5: Kubernetes Deployment manifests
Step 6: Services and load balancing
Step 7: ConfigMaps for configuration
Step 8: Secrets for sensitive data

PHASE 3: PRODUCTION PATTERNS
-----------------------------
Step 9: Resource limits and requests
Step 10: Health checks and probes
Step 11: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
Step 12: Rolling updates strategy

PHASE 4: ADVANCED DEPLOYMENT
-----------------------------
Step 13: Blue-green deployments
Step 14: Canary deployments
Step 15: Production monitoring integration
Step 16: Disaster recovery patterns

ðŸŽ¯ This is the FINAL skill to complete your production toolkit!
