# AI Image Analyzer Architecture

## Overview

The AI Image Analyzer is an enterprise-grade application that provides real-time object detection capabilities for photo analysis using Azure Computer Vision services. The system is designed with modern architectural patterns emphasizing scalability, maintainability, and operational excellence.

## Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between API, business logic, and external services
- **Dependency Injection**: Loosely coupled components for better testability
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking I/O for high performance
- **Type Safety**: Full Python type hints and Pydantic validation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses and comprehensive logging
- **Security**: API key authentication and input validation

## System Components

### API Layer (`src/api/`)

**FastAPI Application** (`main.py`)
- ASGI application with middleware for CORS, security, and metrics
- Structured logging and error handling
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- OpenAPI documentation

**Route Handlers** (`routes.py`)
- RESTful endpoints for image analysis
- Input validation and authentication
- Response serialization and error mapping

### Core Layer (`src/core/`)

**Configuration Management** (`config.py`)
- Environment-based configuration using Pydantic Settings
- Validation and type safety for all configuration values
- Support for development, staging, and production environments

**Exception Handling** (`exceptions.py`)
- Custom exception hierarchy for structured error handling
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Standardized error response format

**Logging** (`logging.py`)
- Structured logging with JSON output for production
- Contextual information injection
- Integration with monitoring systems

### Service Layer (`src/services/`)

**Computer Vision Service** (`computer_vision.py`)
- Azure SDK integration with proper authentication
- Async image processing with timeout handling
- Resilient error handling and retry logic
- Image validation and metadata extraction

### Models Layer (`src/models/`)

**Data Models** (`schemas.py`)
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Type-safe data structures
- JSON serialization with proper encoding

## Data Flow

```
Client Request → API Gateway → Route Handler → Validation → Service Layer → Azure CV → Response
                    ↓              ↓              ↓             ↓             ↓
               Middleware → Auth Check → Transform → Process → Format → Client
```

1. **Request Ingestion**: FastAPI receives HTTP request
   - Middleware processes request (logging, metrics, CORS)
   - Authentication verification (API key)
   - Request validation using Pydantic models

2. **Business Logic**: Route handler orchestrates processing
   - Parameter extraction and transformation
   - Service layer invocation
   - Error handling and response formatting

3. **External Integration**: Computer Vision service processes image
   - Azure SDK authentication (key or managed identity)
   - Image validation and size checks
   - API call with timeout and retry logic
   - Response transformation to internal models

4. **Response Formation**: Structured response generation
   - Result serialization using Pydantic
   - Error mapping to HTTP status codes
   - Logging and metrics collection

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- API key-based authentication for service-to-service communication
- Support for multiple API keys for different clients
- Optional authentication bypass for development environments

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation using Pydantic models
- File size and type restrictions
- URL accessibility validation
- Image format verification

### Data Protection
- No persistent storage of uploaded images
- Secure credential management through environment variables
- Azure Managed Identity support for production deployments

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
- Container-ready with Docker support
- Load balancer friendly with health checks

### Performance Optimization
- Async/await for non-blocking I/O
- Connection pooling for HTTP clients
- Configurable timeouts and concurrency limits
- Image processing optimization

### Resource Management
- Memory-efficient image handling
- Configurable resource limits
- Graceful degradation under load

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks
- Application health endpoint (`/health`)
- Dependency health verification
- Structured health status reporting

### Metrics Collection
- Request/response metrics (`/metrics`)
- Processing time tracking
- Success/failure rate monitoring
- Custom business metrics

### Logging Strategy
- Structured JSON logging for production
- Correlation ID tracking across requests
- Configurable log levels
- Integration with centralized logging systems

## Deployment Patterns

### Container Deployment
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- Non-root container execution
- Health check integration
- Environment-based configuration

### Cloud Deployment
- Azure Container Instances ready
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Azure Service Bus integration potential
- Managed identity authentication

### Development Workflow
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Hot reload support
- Comprehensive test suite
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Categories
1. **Validation Errors**: Input validation failures
2. **Authentication Errors**: API key verification failures
3. **External Service Errors**: Azure Computer Vision API issues
4. **Resource Errors**: File access or processing failures
5. **System Errors**: Unexpected application errors

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "iso-timestamp",
  "error_code": "MACHINE_READABLE_CODE",
  "error_message": "Human readable message",
  "details": {}
}
```

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Comprehensive error logging

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Model validation testing
- Service layer mocking
- Business logic verification
- Error condition coverage

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- External service integration
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Authentication and authorization

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with realistic payloads
- Timeout and concurrency validation
- Memory usage profiling
- Scalability verification

This architecture provides a solid foundation for enterprise-grade image analysis services with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and production-ready operational features.
